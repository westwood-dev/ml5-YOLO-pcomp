# Object detection with PCOMP controls

A project using p5.js, ml5.js, and Arduino over serial for object detection.

## Description

This project combines the power of p5.js, ml5.js, and Arduino to perform object detection. The p5.js library is used for creating interactive visuals, while ml5.js provides pre-trained machine learning models for object detection (yolo). Arduino is used to establish a serial connection with the computer, allowing real-time communication between the hardware and software components, via the Serial.js library.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using pre-trained machine learning models
- Interactive visuals created with p5.js
- Arduino integration for hardware communication

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

- p5.js: [Installation guide](https://p5js.org/get-started/)
- serial.js: [Available here](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js) (Under '\_libraries/serial.js')
- ml5.js: [Installation guide](https://ml5js.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Arduino IDE: [Download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Usage

1. Wire two potentiometers to your Arduino, following the wiring guide above.
3. Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.
4. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided Arduino sketch [here](arduino/ml5_yolo_control/ml5_yolo_control.ino) to your Arduino board.
5. Run the p5.js sketch by opening `index.html` in a web browser or using VSCode [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the object detection system.
